.. module:: plata.default_settings


``PLATA_PRICE_INCLUDES_TAX``:
  Determines whether prices are shown with tax included by default. This
  setting does not influence internal calculations in any way.

  Defaults to ``True``


``PLATA_ORDER_PROCESSORS``:
  The list of order processors which are used to calculate line totals,
  taxes, shipping cost and order totals.

  The classes can be added directly or as a dotted python path. All
  classes should extend :class:`~plata.shop.processors.ProcessorBase`.


``PLATA_PAYMENT_MODULES``:
  The list of payment modules which can be used to pay the order. Currently,
  all available modules are enabled too.


``PLATA_PAYMENT_MODULE_NAMES``
  The user-visible names of payment modules can be modified here. Example::

      PLATA_PAYMENT_MODULE_NAMES = {'paypal': _('Paypal and credit cards')}


``PLATA_SHIPPING_FIXEDAMOUNT``:
  If you use :class:`~plata.shop.processors.FixedAmountShippingProcessor`,
  you should fill in the cost incl. tax and tax rate here.

  Defaults to ``{'cost': Decimal('8.00'), 'tax': Decimal('7.6')}``

``PLATA_ZIP_CODE_LABEL``:
  Since ZIP code is far from universal, and more an L10N than I18N issue...
  Defaults to ``'ZIP code'``.

``PLATA_SHIPPING_WEIGHT_UNIT`` and ``PLATA_SHIPPING_LENGTH_UNIT``:
  If you use :class:`~plata.shop.shipping.Postage` and donâ€™t like metric units,
  you can change them here. Defaults to ``'g'`` resp. ``'mm'``.
  No calculations involved, just a display string.

``PLATA_REPORTING_STATIONERY``:
  Stationery used by PDFDocument to render invoice and packing slip PDFs.

``PLATA_PDF_FONT_NAME``:
  Custom regular font name to be used by PDFDocument for rendering PDF invoices. Defaults to ``''`` (using default of ``reportlab``).

``PLATA_PDF_FONT_PATH``
  Custom regular font path to be used by PDFDocument for rendering PDF invoices. Defaults to ``''``.

``PLATA_PDF_FONT_BOLD_NAME``
  Custom bold font path to be used by PDFDocument for rendering PDF invoices. Defaults to ``''``.

``PLATA_PDF_FONT_BOLD_PATH``
  Custom bold font path to be used by PDFDocument for rendering PDF invoices. Defaults to ``''``.

``PLATA_STOCK_TRACKING``:
  Accurate transactional stock tracking. Needs the ``plata.product.stock``
  Django application.

  Each stock change will be recorded as a distinct entry in the database.
  Products will be locked when an order is confirmed for 15 minutes, which
  means that it's not possible to begin or end the checkout process when
  stock is limited and someone else has already started paying.


``CURRENCIES``:
  A list of available currencies. Defaults to ``('CHF', 'EUR', 'USD', 'CAD')``.
  You should set this variable for your shop.


``PLATA_SHOP_PRODUCT``:
  Target of order item product foreign key in ``app_label.model_name``
  notation. Defaults to ``'product.Product'``
