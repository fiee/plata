Examples
========

Plata's repository contains a few example projects, which are used both
to demonstrate specific features and allow experimentation.

The purpose of each example project will be briefly described in the
following.


``simple`` example
==================

This example strives to be the simplest shop implementation with Plata
while still following best practice.


``custom`` example
==================

The custom example demonstrates how the bundled contact model might be
replaced with a custom model -- in this case, the replacement model only
has one address record, not two addresses, one for shipping and one for
billing.


``staggered`` example
=====================

This example demonstrates how a staggered (or "tiered") price scheme
might be implemented outside of Plata's core.


``oneprice`` example
====================

This example demonstrates how a product model might be made even simpler:
By extending ``ProductBase`` and ``PriceBase`` at the same time, all
product related information is kept in one Django model. This (obviously)
means that each product can only have one price.


``generic`` example
===================

Plata accepts only one product model. But you might want to sell widely
differing stuff, like physical things and downloads, that need different models.
This example shows how to setup a product model with a generic relationship
to the real product.

The data entry is somewhat complicated – first create some "Things" and
"Downloads", then edit the "Products" for their prices.

This example also uses the ``CountryGroup`` from ``plata.shipping`` to implement
prices that depend on the customer’s country.


setup for examples
==================

* make sure that ``examples/manage.py`` is configured to use your example
  of choice, e.g. 'simple'.
* setup basic Django models: ``./manage.py migrate``
* prepare shop models (important: all at once, otherwise you’ll run into
  a dependency hell): ``./manage.py makemigrations shop contact discount simple``
* setup shop models: ``./manage.py migrate``
* create an user: ``./manage.py createsuperuser``
  (the examples contain no user management and depend on admin staff users.)
* create tax classes, products, discounts etc. at the admin site

If you want to try different examples, you must delete the migrations from
shop, contact and discount!

For your convenience, we included two (bash) shell scripts, to be called
from within the examples directory of a git checkout.

* `reset-migrations.sh` lets you delete the migrations from all examples
  and all plata modules.
* `startexample.sh` automates the necessary migrations setup and starts
  one example.

There are some checks and prompts to avoid damage, but of course we can’t be
held responsible for anything that happens.
