Plata - the lean and mean Django-based Shop
===========================================

This is the documentation for fiee’s fork of Feinheit’s project.
Find the sources at https://github.com/fiee/plata

Overview
========

Instead of fighting against a big and all-knowing shop system, which
never does the right thing although it “only requires pushing a few
configuration buttons here and there”, Plata caters to the programmer
by only providing order, payment and discount models and some code
for cart, checkout and payment views. Building a shop on top of Django
and Plata still requires programming – but that's what we do after all.
